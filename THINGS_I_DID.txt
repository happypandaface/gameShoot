You have to have MinGW installed and in the path to use the batch files. I may add a Makefile in the future. I have a bunch of libs in the ./lib folder that should cover the libraries not found in a basic MinGW install on a windows machine.


-- ADVANCED --

So in ./build, some of the files aren't built by my build script (as you've probably noticed), namely "alut.dll" and "OpenAL32.dll" I want to explain how exactly to obtain these.

alut.dll I obtained from googling alut windows binaries, pretty simple.

But when searching for OpenAL32.dll, I found the site openal.org to be down and all the creative links to be 404'd. So it is actually just the soft openal dll, "soft_oal.dll" that has been renamed to "OpenAL32.dll" I hope this helps?


-- LINUX --
there is a makefile that will compile this game on CentOS. But it's kinda tricky.
DEPENDENCIES:
opengl
libpng
glut (freeglut works well)
zlib
alut (freealut works well)
openal (openal soft works well)

CentOS has YUM which doesn't have freeglut or (the correct version of) libpng, so to get those two
working you first get opengl through yum, then we have to manually get
freeglut and install with ./configure -> make -> sudo make install that's
easy. Now for libpng. libpng relies on zlib and while yum supplies a version
of that, I couldn't get my download of libpng to find it and zlib is small, so
I just downloaded it again and built it (conf -> make -> install). Then I
built libpng the same way. IMPORTANT PART: this would still cause libpng to
fail on runtime "error while loading shared libraries" this is because in the
make install of libpng it puts the so files in /usr/local/lib/ when your runtime
only looks in /usr/lib/ the glaring solution is more symbolic links, but what
I did is set (export) LD_LIBRARY_PATH to /usr/local/lib in my .bashrc and then I
sourced it bam! it works!
You can also edit your /etc/ld.so.conf file to make the dynamic linker look in
that folder "/usr/local/lib" this is apparently a better solution because of
some reason

TODO get audio working in LINUX.
